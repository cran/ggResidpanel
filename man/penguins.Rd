\description{
A dataset that contains information from a study done on dives of emperor penguins by
Jessica Meir and others. The scientists were interested in understanding how the heart
rate of the penguins relates to the depth and duration of the dive. The study involved
attaching a device to penguins that recorded the heart rate of the bird during a dive.
The dataset contains multiple observations recorded from 9 penguins. The dataset has
125 observations and 4 variables.

\details{
The variables in the dataset are as follows.
\tabular{ll}{
 \code{heartrate} \tab Heart rate of the penguin during the dive (beats per minute) \cr
 \code{depth} \tab Depth of the dive (meters) \cr
 \code{duration} \tab Duration of the dive (minutes) \cr
 \code{bird} \tab The id number associated with a penguin}
